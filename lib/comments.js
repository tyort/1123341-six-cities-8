      "Greta Yarbrough is my new favorite neighbor. She moved in a few weeks ago. She likes to come over, hang out, toss around the Aerobie, take off her clothes and be photographed. Chill shit. If you don't have a neighbor like her, you\re truly missing out. More indoor photos of Greta coming in part two. Talk soon.",

      'This is part II of my evening with Wendy Patton. She had a sugar high after the ice cream and subsequently a sugar crash. The greater Los Angeles area is home to over 18 million people. Finding girls like Wendy from within that pool is not an easy task, but it is rewarding.',

      'When the opportunity presented itself to photograph Morgan Attwood at a vineyard, there was no hesitation. After the horrible fire season last year, many of these beautiful places in California became scorched earth. This year, I will be surprised if the crisis does not repeat itself. Climate change can suck a fat one. More wine dreams with Morgan coming soon.',

      'Kerstin Dorsia wanted to get photographed in a few different outfits. So I told her that she should just put on a bedroom fashion show for me. Not only did she oblige, but she also showed me a trick she could do with a banana. Good lord. I have photographed many beautiful women, but even I had to pause in wonder when I flipped through a few of these results.',

      "I arrived alone in Krasnodar in the late afternoon and did some quick exploring for a nature spot to photograph Diana Sedova the next day. Included in this set are my initial scouting photos. Wealth does not seem abundant in this city, but I don't travel for your typical tourism. With shoots like these, I try to uncover the beauty that most people overlook. I want to show both the struggle and wonder that is present everywhere. I seek the Truth. Plus, I really love an amazing set of natural tits. Cancel me. Cancel everybody.",

      "These photos took sacrifice. Nikki promised herself this semester would be different, that she would get serious about school and erase the distractions. But Nikki didn't factor in the Venice punctuality, or lack thereof. So instead of listening to some old dude reiterate chapter two of macroeconomics, she was busy soaking in a bubble bath getting her picture taken. What is happening to today's youth?",

      'It is nice that some people go to college and devote their energy towards building respectable careers. Some of which include insurance broker, government program manager, linguist, and commercial real estate agent. Then there are people like me, who come to your city and hire open-minded young women to be photographed for their smutty website. Hey, at least I made it through Sober October. Chapel Hill was nice. Fawn Richfield was nicer.',

      "Here's some sunlight to brighten your day with these photos of Stacie Jaxxx. The weather was unusually warm this week in the Los Angeles area. I was able to comfortably walk outside in only a t-shirt and jeans in the middle of the night. Yep, ever since McDonald's opened up a 24/7 location in my neighborhood, I frequent the burger joint on a vampire's schedule. The late night staff practically knows me by name and is aware of my penchant for holiday pies. If you do not know what those are, get to McDeez right away and thank me later. Anyways, back to the photos. It is hard to find a girl on this site (or any other) that has a lighter complexion and more brilliantly blonde hair than Stacie's. I'm lovin' it.",

She can strike you as your average warm, bubbly, cute teenager and she knows just how to use this to her advantage. After some impromptu shopping, her and I had an adventure running around on the vacant warehouse streets near Downtown LA. Jessie is the real deal.",

      "Sparrow Morris again in all her glory at her spacious home in Santa Clarita. Since I took these, she apparently moved back to Canada. Another one bites the dust I guess. Los Angeles will never be written about like a city such as Paris, but I still love this place. There's a bit of everything here. Ten years and counting for me in this temperate land. Still waiting for that great quake to shake me off into the Pacific.",

      "Sorry to break your hearts, strong guys, but I got a man now. He is in immaculate shape. He can squat 350. He shaves all of his body hair on a nightly basis. He can do a full split with minimal effort and he hasn't eaten a carb since early 2019. Best of all, my man isn't the jealous type. If I want to have a three-way, we both jump on Tinder to look for recruits. He's into Hispanic \"bad boys\". Golly, I adore him.",

      "I picked up Ophelia Palantine and she immediately began feening for her Starbucks fix. How anyone could say no to a woman wearing a top like this is beyond me. After loading up on vitamin caffeine, we decided to check out the Renaissance Hotel. It took about 5 minutes before we got kicked out of the hotel's beautiful atrium. Apparently, Ophelia was drawing too much attention. We kept our cool and found a shit ton of other spots to shoot on the premises. Enjoy part one.",

You think repressing sexuality is the solution, but that only works for a while. I am playing the long game. Future generations are not going to drink your shitty Kool-Aid. We won't be told our nature is uncouth. Your rules, your system, they did not work. Nice try, but is now our turn.",

      'Olive Southard has a sweetness and patience to her that would convince parents to trust her with their offspring. And they do. An eighteen-year-old with model looks that also happens to be your babysitter. Geez, it sounds like the setup for a movie with Olive as the tempting teen. Speaking of kids/babies, I recently received word that one of the previous Zishy girls is pregnant and is starting to show. Guess the expectant mother shoot is coming soon. Haters beware. Be the first to comment here on who you think it is and I will give you a free something. Only one guess, folks!',

I call them useless because I don't need nourishment when I'm out with a beautiful lady. I live off adrenaline until the point of exhaustion, then excuse myself to go pound a few pints of baby formula. But that shit is getting pricey. Good luck.",

Tori has reviewed a few of these and agrees that she looks much better without the heavier makeup. Funny, since I had to twist her arm to shed most of it before we went shopping. Another case of less is best.',

Just about each week, I receive a notice from a random, kind person alerting me that Zishy photos are being stolen and shared freely at some nefarious web destination. Look, if you can afford to support my work, then your subscription is appreciated and I wish you nothing but love in this life. If not, then I recommend abstinence from Zishy. I mean, you are welcome to have your computer double-fisted by pop-ups and malware found on these 'free' sites.

She likes to smoke and drink because it makes her feel good. If you ask Moon what her political views are, she will tell you. Most importantly, Moon doesn't feel remorse about showing off her exquisite body. She loves herself fully which in today's climate seems rare. I'm a fan. More from this evening to come.",

      "It will be hard to say goodbye to Adriene Macedo. This is her last update. Fortunately, there will be a second part to it and probably some bonus video. She is a phenom in many ways. I was enamored with Adriene from afar for quite a while before she agreed to shoot. Her body type is rare and completely natural. She is into extreme activities like riding dirt bikes and kickboxing. Whoever is trying to blackmail her, threatening to show her Zishy pics to her family and friends, that's shitty of you. Woefully, she is not the first. And then I constantly have people also asking why I don't tag my models' social media. Yup.",
